Assignment 3 - The Towers of Hanoi

To use the program user must first run it by specifying an option flag of either -s or -r or both, corresponding to stack and recursive implementations of the game. If these are the only options provided the game will use a default disks number of 5. To play with more disks, player must use option plag -n following their choise of the -r -s or both and can then input their desired number. For example: tower -s -n 7 will run the game using stacks implementation of 7 disks. If user enters no options or invalid ones that are not the 3 flags above then program will terminate returnin error. To use Makefile user can enter make all to successfully build program.
